        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>4 cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp jam or jelly of choice</li>
            <li>Food colouring of choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a hand or stand mixer, whip butter until soft and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. *Note, don't allow butter to become too warm at this stage.</li>
            <li>Incorporate the podwered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time until fully incorporated. A consistency slightly thicker than goal is wanted here, as the next stage will actually
                thin it slightly.
            </li>
            <li>Add in your jam or jelly of choice for flavouring (strawberry is a easy first use, but try to avoid the jams with large chunks of berries as it will distort the buttercream's
                final consistency.
            </li>
            <li>Add in food colouring and continue to mix until desired colour is reached.</li>
        </ol>
