        alt="a multi-layered lasagna made of wheat noodles and meat sauce sits on a white round plate">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This lasagna is reminiscent of the foods I grew up eating, and should be a staple in every good cook's home repertoire. The ingredients are either already in your pantry and
            freezer or they are readily available at any local grocer.
        </p>
        <p>This dish will pair nicely with a full bodied red wine, for the drinkers in the house, that will allow the acidity of the tomato sauce to cut through while still highlighting
            the bold flavours. For a non-alcoholic option, an Italian soda or another carbonated beverage could be fun and a way to brighten up a heavier dish like lasagna. A meal in it's
            own regard, few bother putting anything else to the table outside of adding some extra carbs by way of a garlic, or even cheesy garlic bread.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 packet x lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>2 x 16oz cans of tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow or sweet onion</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheese (mozerella recommended)</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425F.</li>
            <li>Bring to boil a large pot of salted water, add lasagna noodles and stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Cook for 8-10 minutes or as per package directions.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a pan to medium heat, add the oil. Finely chop or dice the onions and add when oil is heated through.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef to onions and break apart using spatula or wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>When the meat has turned brown, add tomato sauce and heat through, set aside when heated.</li>
            <li>Strain noodles and lightly oil to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Inside of a casserole pan, or loaf pan for smaller portions, layer enough flat noodles to cover base, and proceed to layer with tomato and meat sauce until noodles
                are mostly covered.
            </li>
            <li>Alternate between layers of noodles and sauce until you have reached the top of your dish or the end of your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Top with shredded cheese mix.</li>
            <li>Bake in oven covered for 45 mins, then uncovered for 10-15 or until cheese becomes golden brown in colour.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let cool 15-20 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
        </ol>
