        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A crisp spring morning with fresh dew on the grass, the rising sun, and a hot tea in a mug warming your hands as you sit on the patio of your favourite Parisien cafe.
            These are the sorts of feelings one can have evoked with each bight of the bright and sweet french macarons. While my partner's favourite remains the strawberry delights
            I make on occasion, the flavour combinations are nearly endless with these treats. Below you can read the basic almond recipe with a sweet jam buttercream, but once you're
            feeling comfortable with the technique, the world is your macaron.
        </p>
        <p>While it's true that the technique alone for macarons can be a little daunting to look at, it is equally true that with careful focus and close attention, you can turn this
            delicate recipe into a casual regular in your arsenal. The real challenge outside of technique, is quality ingredients. Being able to get a nice almond flour vs an almond meal
            can be key, although it is possible to make the almond meal work. I would secondly say, on the ingredients, that your choice of colouring will make or break your macarons. It
            can be both heart breaking but also eye opening to see how a single simple ingredient can turn your light and fluffy french cookies into a pile of waste.
